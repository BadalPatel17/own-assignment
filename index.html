      Mortal Kombat is one of my favorite all time video games. I love the game
      because the storymode is really interesting but you can also play 1v1 with
      your friends or random people from the internet. It is really Fun!

    <p>
      I love to play chess! Ever since covid hit I have loved to play chess and
      I usually play a couple times a week on chess.com. My rank used to be at
      1300 but stopped playing for a couple of months after school started so I
      went down to a 1000.

    <p>
      Ever since I was young I have loved watching boxing and MMA. I have always
      had a passion of learning martial arts and performing them in tournamnts.
      This passion has lead me to currently be enrolled in Muay Tai where I have
      learned different styles of kickboxing as well as the fundamentals of Muay
      Tai.
